# .github

GitHub metadata and shared workflows. The repo name `.github` has special significance to GitHub within an organization, so don't treat this as a normal code repository.

## Shared Workflows

GitHub requires shared workflows to be in a public repo, we are storing them in here. These workflows are specific to Lumio and aren't believed to be generally useful outside our organziation, but they are MIT licensed.

## Starter Workflows

GitHub supports [starter workflow templates](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/creating-starter-workflows-for-your-organization) as a way to quickly set up a workflow in a new repo. These are required to live in this repo too, but this isn't applicable yet since we aren't on GitHub Enterprise.

## Feedback and Contributing

We don't anticipate outside contributions to these workflows. If you believe we have something more generally useful here, feel free to open an issue in this repo to discuss it.
